Brett Storyâ€™s incisive and acclaimed documentary shot in New York City during the hottest summer on record (August 2019) is available for home viewing via Grasshopper Film. A portion of ticket sales goes to support the Museum. Critic Adam Nayman wrote about the film for CinemaScope last year: [The Hottest August](https://grasshopperfilm.vhx.tv/checkout/momi-presents-the-hottest-august/purchase).
